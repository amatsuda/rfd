## Start Me Up

Open up your terminal and type:

    % rfd

You can also pass in a starting directory name, which defaults to `.`.

    % rfd ~/src/rails

## Commands

You can send commands to rfd by pressing some chars on your keyboard, just like Vim.
If you're unfamiliar with this sort of command system, I recommend you to play with `vimtutor` before you go any further.

All available commands in rfd are defined as Ruby methods here. https://github.com/amatsuda/rfd/tree/master/lib/rfd/commands.rb

### Changing the current directory

* **\<Enter\>**: cd into the directory where the cursor is on.
* **\<Delete\>** (or \<Backspace\> on your keyboard, probably?): Go up to the upper directory (cd ..).
* **-**: Get back to where you once belonged (popd).

### Moving the cursor

* **j**: Move down.
* **k**: Move up.
* **h**: Move left. At the leftmost column, move to the right end column at the previous page.
* **l**: Move right. At the rightmost column, move to the left end column at the next page.

### The {count} parameter

Some commands such as `j` or `k` take a number parameter called {count}. For passing a {count} parameter, just type in a number prior to the command.
For example, `3j` moves the cursor to 3 lines below, and `999k` will take your cursor to 999 lines above.

### Jumping the cursor

* **H**: Move to the top of the current page.
* **M**: Move to the middle of the current page.
* **L**: Move to the bottom of the current page.

### Switching the page

* **ctrl-n, ctrl-f**: Move to the top of the next page.
* **ctrl-p, ctrl-b**: Move to the top of the previous page.
* **g**: Move to the top of the first page.
* **G**: Move to the bottom of the last page.

### Finding a file / directory

You can find a file by typing the first letter of it immediately after the find commands.

* **f{char}**: Move to the next file / directory of which name starts with the given char.
* **F{char}**: Move to the previous file / directory of which name starts with the given char.
* **n**: Repeat the last `f` or `F`.

### Searching, sorting

For commands like these that require a parameter string, type the parameter in the command line at the bottom of the screen, and press \<Enter\>.

* **/**: Grep the current directory with the given parameter. The parameter will be interpreted as Ruby Regexp (e.g. `.*\.rb$`).
* **s**: Sort files / directories in the current directory in the given order.
    * (none): by name
    * r     : reverse order by name
    * s, S  : order by file size
    * sr, Sr: reverse order by file size
    * t     : order by mtime
    * tr    : reverse order by mtime
    * c     : order by ctime
    * cr    : reverse order by ctime
    * u     : order by atime
    * ur    : reverse order by atime
    * e     : order by extname
    * er    : reverse order by extname

### Marking files / directories

You can send a command to the file / directory on which the cursor is on. Or, you can send a command to multiple files / directories at once by marking them first.
The mark is drawn as a `*` char on the left of each file / directory name.

* **\<Space\>**: Mark / unmark current file / directory.
* **ctrl-a**: Mark / unmark all file / directories in the current directory.

### Manipulating files / directories

As stated above, you can send a command to one or more files / directories. In this document, the term "selected items" means "(the marked files / directories) || (the file / directory on which the cursor is on)".

* **c**: Copy selected items (cp).
* **m**: Move selected items (mv).
* **d**: Move selected items into the Trash.
* **D**: Delete selected items.
* **r**: Rename selected items. This command takes a sed-like argument separated by a `/`. For example, changing all .html files' extention to .html.erb could be done by `\.html$/.html.erb`.

### Creating files / directories

* **t**: Create a new file (touch).
* **K**: Creat a new directory (mkdir).
* **S**: Create new symlink to the current file / directory (ln -s).

### Attributes

* **a**: Change permission of selected items (chmod). Takes chmod-like argument such as `g+w`, `755`.
* **w**: Change the owner of of selected items (chown). Takes chown-like argument such as `alice`, `nobody:nobody`.

### Viewing, Editing, Opening

* **\<Enter\>**: View current file with the system $VIEWER such as `less`.
* **v**: View current file with the system $VIEWER such as `less`.
* **e**: Edit current file with the system $EDITOR such as `vim`.
* **o**: Send the `open` command.

### Manipulating archives

* **u**: Unarchive .zip, .gz, or .tar.gz file into the current directory.
* **z**: Archive selected items into a .zip file with the given name.

### Handling .zip files

You can `cd` into a .zip file as if it's just a directory, then unarchive selected items, view files in it, and even create new files or edit files in the archive.

### Splitting columns

* **ctrl-w**: Change the window split size to the {count} value (e.g. `4<C-w>` to split the window into 4 columns). The default number of columns is 2.

### Using mouse

Mouse is available if your terminal supports it. You can move the cursor by clicking on a file / directory. Double clicking on a file / directory is equivalent to pressing \<Enter\> on it.

### Misc

* **ctrl-l**: Refresh the whole screen.
* **C**: Copy selected items' paths to the clipboard.
* **O**: Open a new terminal window at the current directory.
* **!**: Execute a shell command.
* **q**: Quit the app.

## How to manually execute a command, or how the commands are executed

By pressing `:`, you can enter the command-line mode. Any string given in the command line after `:` will be executed as Ruby method call in the `Controller` instance.
For instance, `:j` brings your cursor down, `:mkdir foo` makes a directory named "foo". And `:q!` of course works as you might expect, since `q!` method is implemented so.
